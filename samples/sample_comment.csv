Thank you for your support always.

    Our QA has reported this issue. Printing took 4 minutes for this 4-page-test-file. From the apip logs we observer that there some delay from engine in printing the job even after fiery sends ""GO"" command. And I was seeing a delay of nearly 100sec in GS command from engine for page 3 to page 4. Please find the below snippet of logs. Could you please review this from engine side. Please find the attached apip logs(aegis_apip0.zip).
Go command from fiery to engine for page 3. 
0001996073: TX: [GO ] job id=0x0601, process id=3, mode=0 
0001996073: input source=0x0010, output dest.=0x0100, paper id=3, paper count=0x01
